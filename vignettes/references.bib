  abstract  = "[A class of linear rank statistics is proposed for the k-sample
               problem with right-censored survival data. The class contains as
               special cases the log rank test (Mantel, 1966; Cox, 1972) and a
               test essentially equivalent to Peto \& Peto's (1972)
               generalization of the Wilcoxon test. martingale theory is used
               to establish asymptotic normality of test statistics under the
               null hypotheses considered, and to derive expressions for
               asymptotic relative efficiencies under contiguous sequences of
               alternative hypotheses. A class of distributions is presented
               which corresponds to the class of rank statistics in the sense
               that for each distribution there is a statistic with some
               optimal properties for detecting location alternatives from that
               distribution. Some Monte Carlo results are displayed which
               present small sample behaviour.]",

  abstract = "Summary The analysis of censored failure times is considered. It
              is assumed that on each individual are available values of one or
              more explanatory variables. The hazard function (age-specific
              failure rate) is taken to be a function of the explanatory
              variables and unknown regression coefficients multiplied by an
              arbitrary and unknown function of time. A conditional likelihood
              is obtained, leading to inferences about the unknown regression
              coefficients. Some generalizations are outlined.",
