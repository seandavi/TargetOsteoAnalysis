  abstract = "Summary The analysis of censored failure times is considered. It
              is assumed that on each individual are available values of one or
              more explanatory variables. The hazard function (age-specific
              failure rate) is taken to be a function of the explanatory
              variables and unknown regression coefficients multiplied by an
              arbitrary and unknown function of time. A conditional likelihood
              is obtained, leading to inferences about the unknown regression
              coefficients. Some generalizations are outlined.",
